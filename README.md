## Return to Return to RiskMetrics

Notes I've made, skimming through RiskMetrics&trade; report "Return to RiskMetrics: The Evolution of a Standard" (2001) by Jorge Mina and Jerry Yi Xiao.  
  
**Why?** The original report, to which this one is a follow-up -- "RiskMetrics -- Technical Document" (1996 4th ed) -- has been hugely influential in the field of risk management. The techniques outlined might feel dated today (and they probably are), but it seems like a useful intro to the risk modeling in general, with more applied real-world perspective than usual textbook expositions, but more rigorous than most tutorials.
